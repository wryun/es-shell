Basic Installation
------------------

   Es now uses the GNU configure system for configuration.  This
means that on nearly all platforms, it should just build and work
fine.  To do this, just type:

   % ./configure
   % make

   If you're building from the source repository rather than a
distribution, it won't have a generated configure file. To generate it,
you'll need to have autotools, and run:

   % aclocal
   % autoconf
   % libtoolize -qi

   Es needs an ANSI compiler (or at least a compiler that respects
protoypes and provides large portions of the ANSI library).
Otherwise it should build with the basic tools available on most UNIX
platforms.

   Es obeys the GNU configure convention of allowing you to build in
a directory different from the source directory.  To do this, just
execute configure with a path to the source.  For example:

   % /path/to/configure

   Also obeying the GNU configure convention, configure will take
arguments specifying a variety of directories.  Currently the only
relevant ones are the prefix directory (/usr/local by default); bindir,
the directory in which `es' will reside ($prefix/bin by default); and
mandir, the directory that will contain the manpage ($prefix/man by
default).  These are given to configure by:

   % ./configure --prefix=directory
   % ./configure --bindir=directory --mandir=directory

   Similarly, setting the `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LDFLAGS' environmental
variables will cause those to be used in the Makefile.

Es Options
----------

  Es can be built to link to two command line editing libraries:
GNU readline and editline.  For information about obtaining these, see
the README file.  These may used by providing, respectively, the
--with-readline or --with-editline respectively.  Readline is currently
enabled by deafult.

Problems with building
----------------------

  The HP-UX yacc program seems to dislike the use of LOCAL in
parse.y.  It is not clear to me why this is the case.  FSF's bison works
fine.  This has not been `fixed' because it is not clear what is
`broken'.  This may also be other dependencies that I do not
understand.
